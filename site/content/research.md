My research work was centered on the study of complex biological systems
through formal analysis of qualitative dynamical models.
I obtained my PhD at [Aix-Marseille University](https://www.univ-amu.fr/) in 2009.
My last research position was a starting research position (Inria SRP, a type of associate researcher)
in the [Lifeware](http://lifeware.inria.fr/) team
at [Inria Saclay - ÃŽle-de-France](https://www.inria.fr/fr/centre-inria-saclay-ile-de-france).


Dynamical models, based on state of the art knowledge of the mechanisms underlying
biological processes, can be used to decipher the behaviour of these systems.
During the modelling process, the comparison between predictions obtained through
the dynamical analysis of such models and the observed phenotypes provide valuable
information about gaps or inconsistencies in our knowledge.
Models capable of reproducing the observed phenotypes can ultimately be used
to guide the design of future experiments.

Qualitative models capture many relevant dynamical behaviours despite their lack
of quantitative values. The use of non-deterministic simulation strategies yields
a large number of alternative dynamical trajectories, which reflects well the
complexity of the systems under study. The removal of unknown quantitative parameters
enables the definition of models encompassing dozens of components. Qualitative
formalisms further provide a framework to develop efficient analytical methods
to identify some dynamical properties without performing costly simulations.

My main contributions to this interdisciplinary research area, combine methodological
developments, software implementation, and applications to biological systems.
