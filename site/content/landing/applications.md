Qualitative models have been applied to a wide range of biological processes.
In particular, GINsim has been used to study dozens of models, either through
collaborations or by independent researchers.
I have been personally involved mainly in the study of cell cycle, and differentiation
of T helper cells.

During my postdoctoral work in Lausanne (Switzerland), I was involved in the
study of genomics data (microarray and ChIP-seq) in the context of metabolic processes.

I also worked on the reconstruction of potential causal paths based on known pathways and proteomics
(differential phosphorylation using the SILAC approach) data of cancer cell lines with different metastatic status.
This work has since been further extended by a PhD student with my former collaborators.
