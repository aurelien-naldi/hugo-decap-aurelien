![profile picture](an.jpeg#right)
I'm a french computer scientist always looking for a balance between pragmatic software development and formal theoretical approches.

I started my career as computational biologist deciphering complex biological systems
through formal analysis of qualitative dynamical models. 

I currently work as senior developer for [IBM Consulting France](https://www.ibm.com/fr-fr/consulting).
